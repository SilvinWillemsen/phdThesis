This part will give several examples of full instrument models that have been developed during the PhD. Chapter \ref{ch:largeScale} shows a three instrument-inspired case-studies using a large-scale modular environment, Chapter \ref{ch:tromba} describes the implementation of the tromba marina and Chapter \ref{ch:trombone} that of the trombone.
