\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introductionDynamic}
Simulating musical instruments using physical modelling -- as mentioned in Part \ref{part:introduction}\todo{check if is still true} -- could potentially allow for manipulations that are impossible in the physical world. Examples of this are changes in material properties, size, etc.  

There are examples in the physical world where certain aspects of the instrument are manipulated in real-time

Some even use this in performance \cite{Gomm2011}
