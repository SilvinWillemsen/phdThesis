\chapter{Conclusions and Perspectives}\label{ch:conclusion}

Both the good and bad thing about physical modelling musical instruments is that you are never done..

There is always more work to be done


\subsubsection{Parameter design}
Many parameters that can always be improved

Possible perspectives could be machine learning based on audio files (literature...)

\subsubsection{Dynamic grid}
In this work, the dynamic grid in Chapter \ref{ch:dynamicGrid} the test case of the 1D wave equation has been explored.
