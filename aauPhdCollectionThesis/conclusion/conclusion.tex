\chapter{Conclusions and Perspectives}\label{ch:conclusion}
\todo{title is the exact same as \cite{theBible}}
Both the good and bad thing about physical modelling musical instruments is that you are never done..

There is always more work to be done


\section{Realism}
We are not there yet.. 

Physical modelling is not here to replace the original instruments and the musicians playing them. Instead, it can be used as a tool to understand the physics of existing instruments and possibly go beyond. Simulated instruments are not restricted by physics anymore and could provide new ways of expression for the musician. 

\subsubsection{Parameter design}
Many parameters that can always be improved

Possible perspectives could be machine learning based on audio files (literature...)

\section{Dynamic grid}
In this work, the dynamic grid in Chapter \ref{ch:dynamicGrid} the test case of the 1D wave equation has been explored.
