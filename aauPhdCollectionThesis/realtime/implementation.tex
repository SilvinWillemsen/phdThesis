Implementation of the physical models
using FDTD methods

As mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:physMod}, FDTD methods are used for high-quality and accurate simulations, rather than for real-time applications. This is due to their lack of simplifications.

Usually, \texttt{MATLAB} is used for simulating 

Here, we define an application as being real-time when
\begin{center}\it
    Control of the application generates or manipulates audio with no noticeable latency.
\end{center}



Also the application needs to be controlled continuously
