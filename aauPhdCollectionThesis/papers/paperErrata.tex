\chapter{Paper Errata}
Here, some errors in the published papers will be listed

\textbf{Tromba marina paper}: The minus sign in Eq. (28) (and thus Eqs. (31) and (35)) should be a plus sign.

\textbf{Tromba marina paper}: $\sigma_{1,\text{s}}$ in Eq. (21) should obviously be $\sigma_{1,\text{p}}$

\textbf{DigiDrum}: $\sigma_0$ and $\sigma_1$ should be multiplied by $\rho H$ in order for the stability condition to hold.

\textbf{DigiDrum}: Stability condition is wrong. Should be: 
\begin{equation}
    h \geq \sqrt{c^2k^2 + 4\sigma_1k + \sqrt{(c^2k^2+4\sigma_1k)^2 + 16\kappa^2k^2}}
\end{equation}

\textbf{DigiDrum}: Unit for membrane tension is N/m.
