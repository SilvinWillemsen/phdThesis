\chapter*{Exciters}
As mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:physMod}, nearly all musical instruments can be subdivided into an exciter and a resonator component. Several resonators have been introduced in Part \ref{part:resonators}, and this Part will introduce different mechanisms to excite these. First, various examples of physically inspired excitations will be presented in Chapter \ref{ch:physInspExcitations}, some of which made a brief appearance in Parts \ref{part:introduction} and \ref{part:resonators}. Chapter \ref{ch:bow} introduces the bow as an excitation mechanism and presents the contribution made in paper \citeP[C]: the elasto-plastic friction model applied to a FDTD-based stiff strings. Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:lipreed} presents the lip reed as a way to excite brass instruments.
