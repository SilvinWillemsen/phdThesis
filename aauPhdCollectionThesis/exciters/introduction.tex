\chapter*{Exciters}
Several resonators have been introduced in part \ref{part:resonators}, different mechanisms to excite them will be introduced here. First, different examples of 

and have a great effect on the eventual timbre of the sound. 
Chapter \ref{ch:physInspExcitations} presents various physically inspired excitations some of which made a brief appearance in Part \ref{part:resonators}. Chapter \ref{ch:bow} introduces a static and a dynamic friction model that can be used for bowing resonators. Additionally, this chapter presents the contribution made in \citeP[C]: the elasto-plastic friction model applied to FDTD stiff strings. Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:lipreed} presents the lip reed as a way to excite brass instruments.
