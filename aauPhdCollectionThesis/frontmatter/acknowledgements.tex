I would like to thank my mom..

Both Stefan Bilbao and his seminal work \textit{Numerical Sound Systhesis} have been invaluable to the result of this project...

Finally, I would like to wholeheartedly thank my supervisor Stefania Serafin for essentially my entire PhD project. I quickly found out that this project was a ``golden ticket'' to do whatever as long as it is publishable. You provided this opportunity and let me be free in my decisions throughout my project and I am extremely grateful for that.
