As my background does (did) not lie in mathematics, physics or computer science, which -- trust me -- were three equally crucial components in creating the result of this project, I added a, say, more pedagogical section at the end of this thesis. These tutorials are a result of the things that I learned and (hopefully) explain topics such as \textit{Energy Analysis},  \textit{Stability Analysis}, etc. in a way so that others with the same background will be able to understand what is going on.
