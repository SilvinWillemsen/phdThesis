\section*{Notes}\label{sec:ch2label}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Think about how to define real-time.
  \item Create an intuition for different parts of the equation
  \item Talk about input and output locations and how that affects frequency content (modes).
\end{itemize}
One over number $\rightarrow$ reciprocal of number

Example: When the waveform consists
entirely of harmonically related frequencies, it will be periodic, with a period equal to the reciprocal of the fundamental frequency (from An Introduction to the Mathematics of Digital Signal Processing Pt 2 by F. R. Moore)
