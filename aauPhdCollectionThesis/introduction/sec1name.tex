\section{History of bowed strings}\label{sec:historyOfBowedStrings}

In static bow-string-interaction models, the friction force is defined as a function of the relative velocity between the bow and the string only. 
The first mathematical description of friction was proposed by Coulomb in 1773 \cite{Coulomb} to which static friction, or \textit{stiction}, was added by Morin in 1833 \cite{Morin1833} and viscous friction, or velocity-dependent friction, by Reynolds in 1886 \cite{Reynolds1886}. In 1902, Stribeck found a smooth transition between the static and the coulomb part of the friction curve now referred to as the Stribeck effect \cite{Stribeck1902}. The latter is still the standard for static friction models today.
