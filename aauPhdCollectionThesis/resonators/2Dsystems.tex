The 2D wave equation be used to model an ideal membrane such as done in Paper 

In this work, it is mainly used to model a simplified body in papers...


State variable $u = u(x,y,t)$  where $t\geq 0$ and $(x,y) \in \D$ where $\D$ is 2-dimensional. The state variable can then be discretised according to $u(x, y, t) \approx \ulmn$ with space $x = lh$ and $y = mh$ and time $t = nk$ and $k=1/\fs$. For simplicity the grid spacing in both the $x$ and $y$ directions are set to be the same but could be different.


The same shift operators as defined in Chapter \ref{ch:FDTD} can be applied to grid function $\ulmn$ 
\begin{equation}
    e_{y+}\ulmn = u_{l, m+1}^n,\quad \text{and}\quad e_{y-}\ulmn= u_{l, m-1}^n.
\end{equation}

Additional operators:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta = \pxx + \pyy
\end{equation}
