\chapter*{Resonators}
Though the physical models described in the previous part are also considered resonators, they are \textit{ideal} cases. In other words, you would not be able to find these ``in the wild" as they do not includes effects such as losses or dispersion in the case of the 1D wave equation.  

\subsubsection{Scaling}
Scaling, or non-dimensionalisation can be useful to reduce the parameter space

Domain $x\in[0, L]$ is scaled to $x' = x/L$ such that $x' \in [0, 1]$.

The 1D wave equation in \eqref{eq:1DwavePDE} can be rewritten to
\begin{equation}
    \ptt u = \gamma^2\partial_{x'x'}u
\end{equation}
where scaled wavespeed $\gamma = c/L$ has units of frequency.

Although this parameter reduction might be useful for resonators in isolation, when they are connected 

Moreover, for the parameters to make

As, later on, different resonators in isolation will be connected, the overview is better kept when all parameters are written out
