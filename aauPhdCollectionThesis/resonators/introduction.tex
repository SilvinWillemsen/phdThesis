\chapter*{Resonators}
Though the physical models described in the previous part are also considered resonators, they are \textit{ideal} cases. In other words, you would not be able to find these ``in the wild'' as they do not includes effects such as losses or frequency dispersion. 

This part presents the different resonators used over the course of the project and is structured as follows: Chapter \ref{ch:stiffString} introduces the stiff string, a model which has been used a lot over the course of this project, Chapter \ref{ch:brass} talks about brass instruments, or more generally, 1D systems of varying geometry along their spatial dimension. Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:2Dsyst} will introduces 2D systems which, in this project, have been used to simulate (simplified) instrument bodies.
