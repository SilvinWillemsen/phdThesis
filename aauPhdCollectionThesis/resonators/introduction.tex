\chapter*{Resonators}
Although the physical models described in the previous part -- the simple mass-spring system and the 1D wave equation -- are also considered resonators, they are \textit{ideal} cases. In other words, you would not be able to find these in the real world as they do not include effects such as losses or frequency dispersion. 

This part presents the different resonators used over the course of the project that are more true to the physical world and is structured as follows: Chapter \ref{ch:stiffString} introduces the stiff string, an extension of the 1D wave equation and is the single most-used model in this project. Chapter \ref{ch:brass} talks about brass instruments, or more generally, 1D systems of varying geometry along their spatial dimension. Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:2Dsyst} will introduces 2D systems which, in this project, have been used to simulate (simplified) instrument bodies. The analysis techniques introduced in the previous section will be applied to all models and explained in detail.
