\chapter*{Resonators}
Although the physical models described in the previous part -- the simple mass-spring system and the 1D wave equation -- are also considered resonators, they are \textit{ideal} cases. In other words, these can not be found in the real world as effects such as losses or frequency dispersion are not included. 

This part presents the different resonators used over the course of the project that better include these non-ideal physical processes and is structured as follows: Chapter \ref{ch:stiffString} introduces the stiff string, an extension of the 1D wave equation, % and is the single most-used model in this project. 
Chapter \ref{ch:brass} introduces acoustic tubes, used to model brass instruments, and finally, Chapter \ref{ch:2Dsyst} introduces 2D systems which, in this project, have been used to simulate (simplified) instrument bodies. The analysis techniques introduced in the previous part will be applied to all models and described in detail.
