\chapter{Connections}\label{ch:connections}
Part \ref{part:resonators} introduced various resonators in isolation. Most traditional musical instruments are made up of several of these systems which all interact with one another

Although briefly mentioned in the previous chapter in Section \ref{sec:twoSidedCollision}, 

One can use connections to simulate a point-like damping finger on a string to create different pitches.

Pointlike $\delta(x-x_\ctxt)$ or distributed $E_\ctxt$

When connecting systems, notation becomes extremely important. Subscripts will be extensively used throughout this chapter to denote what variables belong to what system. Although this results in something of a notational jungle, it is better to be explicit and avoid confusion. 

\cite{Bilbao2009Modular} presents a way to explicitly solve an arbitrary system of connections by writing everything in an extremely compact matrix form... 

\subsubsection{Alternative interpretation of grid points}
Section \ref{sec:gridFunctions} gives an introduction to how a continuous 1D system is subdivided into grid points in space (see Figure \ref{fig:gridExp}) in a process called discretisation. An alternative way to see grid points after discretisation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:gridExp2}. Rather than grid `points' with a spacing $h$ between them, a continuous system is divided into grid `sections' of width $h$. This interpretation allows the `weight' of a grid point to be calculated from its material properties and geometry. Notice that boundaries have a width of $h/2$ such that the total length $L = Nh$ m.

As an example, the weight of one grid point (or now rather grid section) of a string can be calculated as $\rho A h$. The weight of one grid point of a 2D plane can be calculated as $\rho H h^2$. As these grid points interact with each other, the forces resulting from this interaction will scaled by their respective weight per grid point as will be shown in Section \ref{sec:stringPlateConnection}.
This interpretation hopefully provides a better intuition for the interactions between components shown in this chapter.

\section{Connected ideal strings}
As an example, consider two ideal strings of length $L_u$ and $L_w$ (both in m) their transverse displacement denoted as $u=u(x,t)$ and $w = w(\chi,t)$ (both in m) (see Section \ref{sec:1DWave}).\footnote{Recall that the ideal string is the 1D wave equation with $c=\sqrt{T/\rho A}$.}  The systems are defined for $x\in \D_u$ with domain $\D_u=[0,L_u]$ and $\chi \in \D_w$ with domain $\D_w=[0,L_w]$ respectively. Notice that $\chi$ is used as the spatial coordinate for $w$ to denote that the two systems are defined over different spatial coordinates. Connecting these systems at $x_\ctxt\in \D_u$ and $\chi_\ctxt\in\D_w$ yields the following system of PDEs:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:conn1DwavePDE}
    \begin{align}
        \rho_u A_u \ptt u &= T_u \pxx u -\delta(x-x_\ctxt)f, \label{eq:conn1DwavePDEu} \\
        \rho_w A_w \ptt w &= T_w \partial_\chi^2 w + \delta(\chi-\chi_\ctxt)f,\label{eq:conn1DwavePDEw}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where subscripts $u$ and $w$ denote whether a variable belongs to system $u$ or $w$ respectively. Notice that the partial derivative operator in Eq. \eqref{eq:conn1DwavePDEw} denotes a partial derivative with respect to $\chi$. Furthermore, $f = f(t)$ is the connection force (in N) which should be equal and opposite for the connected systems (hence the inverse signs). The definition for $f$ depends on the connection type, and two alternatives will be given shortly. Finally, the spatial Dirac delta function $\delta$ is defined as in Eq. \eqref{eq:spatialDirac}, and localises the connection force along the systems.


\subsubsection{Relative location of objects}\todo{look at this compared to when I talk about it in chapter \ref{ch:collisions}}
Notice that it is important to keep in mind the relative location of the connected objects i.e., whether one object is `above' or `below' an other. 
If component $a$ is located above component $b$, and their relative displacement is defined as $\eta = a-b$, then a positive $\eta$ is going to have a negative effect on $a$ and a positive effect on $b$ and vice-versa. This is important for the signs when adding the force terms to the schemes.


Forces should be equal and opposite. 

\subsection{Discrete time}
One can then discretise the states $u$ and $w$ to grid functions $\uln$ and $\wmn$ where $l\in \{0, \hdots, N_u\}$ and $m\in \{0, \hdots, N_w\}$.\footnote{Here, $m$ is used for the spatial index of $\wmn$ to avoid double subscripts $l_u$ and $l_w$.} Dividing  Eqs. \eqref{eq:conn1DwavePDEu} and \eqref{eq:conn1DwavePDEw} by $\rho_u A_u$ and $\rho_w A_w$ respectively yields
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:conn1DwaveFDS}
    \begin{align}
        \dtt \uln &= c_u^2 \dxx \uln -J_{l, u}(x_\ctxt)\frac{f^n}{\rho_u A_u}, \label{eq:conn1DwaveFDSu} \\
        \dtt \wmn &= c_w^2 \delta_{\chi\chi} \wmn + J_{m, w}(\chi_\ctxt)\frac{f^n}{\rho_w A_w},\label{eq:conn1DwaveFDSw}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $c_u = \sqrt{T_u / \rho_uA_u}$ and $c_w = \sqrt{T_w / \rho_wA_w}$. The spreading operators $J_{l, u}(x_\ctxt) = J_{l, o_u, u}(x_\ctxt)$ and $J_{l, w}(\chi_\ctxt) = J_{l, o_w, w}(\chi_\ctxt)$ are as defined in Section \ref{sec:interpolationSpreading}, and their orders $o_u$ and $o_w$ are left unspecified. 

\subsection{Implementation}

The next step is to solve for the force $f^n$.

\subsection{Rigid connection}
The simplest connection-type is the \textit{rigid connection}. This connection type states that the displacement of two connected points should always be equal, and thus the distance between them should be 0 at all times. 


For the rigid connection, the following is true
\begin{equation}\label{eq:contRigid}
    u(x_\ctxt, t) = w(\chi_\ctxt, t)
\end{equation}

In discrete time, the rigid connection in Eq. \eqref{eq:contRigid} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:discRigid}
    I_{l, u}(x_\ctxt)\uln = I_{m, w}(\chi_\ctxt)\wmn,
\end{equation}
where interpolation operators $I_{l, u}(x_\ctxt) = I_{l, o_u, u}(x_\ctxt)$ and $I_{l, w}(\chi_\ctxt) = I_{l, o_w, w}(\chi_\ctxt)$ are as defined in Section \ref{sec:interpolationSpreading}. Notice that the order of these operators need to match their `dual' spreading operator, but the orders $o_u$ and $o_w$ may differ.


Figure \ref{fig:connectedWaveEqs} shows two an implementation of system \ref{eq:conn1DwaveFDS} with $x_\ctxt = 0.25$ and $\chi_\ctxt = 0.75$. The wave equations have the same mass per unit length, i.e., $\rho_uA_u = \rho_wA_w$ but

\end{figure}

\subsection{Modal analysis}


\section{Spring-like connections}

Forces are still equal and opposite as the springs are not distributed...

\subsection{Connection with rigid barrier (scaled)}
Consider the (scaled) 1D wave equation with an additional force term $F^n$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1DwaveConnRigid}
    \dtt \uln = \gamma^2\dxx \uln + J_l(x_\ctxt)F^n
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1DwaveConnRigidForce}
    F^n = -\omega_0^2\mtd\eta^n - \omega_1^4(\eta^n)^2\mtd\eta^n - 2\sigma_\times \dtd \eta^n
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:etaRigid}
    \eta^n = I_l(x_\ctxt)\uln.
\end{equation}

To obtain $F^n$, an inner product of scheme \eqref{eq:1DwaveConnRigid} needs to be taken with $J_l(x_\ctxt)$ over domain $\D$ which, using identity \eqref{eq:identityIJ} yields 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1DwaveConnRigidInnerProd}
    \dtt I_l(x_\ctxt)\uln = \gamma^2 I_l(x_\ctxt)\dxx \uln + \underbrace{I_l(x_\ctxt)J_l(x_\ctxt)}_{\lVert J_l(x_\ctxt) \rVert^2_\D}F^n.
\end{equation}
As $u$ is connected to a rigid barrier according to \eqref{eq:etaRigid}, a shortcut can be taken and Eqs. \eqref{eq:1DwaveConnRigidForce} and \eqref{eq:etaRigid} can be directly substituted into Eq. \eqref{eq:1DwaveConnRigidInnerProd} to get
\begin{equation}
    \dtt \eta^n = \gamma^2 I_l(x_\ctxt)\dxx \uln + \lVert J_l(x_\ctxt)\rVert^2_\D\left( -\omega_0^2\mtd\eta^n - \omega_1^4(\eta^n)^2\mtd\eta^n - 2\sigma_\times \dtd \eta^n\right).
\end{equation}
and solved for $\eta^{n+1}$:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    &\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\Big(1 + \lVert J_l(x_\ctxt)\rVert^2_\D k^2[\omega_0^2/2 + \omega_1^4(\eta^n)^2/2 + \sigma_\times/k] \Big)\eta^{n+1} \\
   = &\ 2 \eta^n - \Big(1 + \lVert J_l(x_\ctxt)\rVert^2_\D k^2[\omega_0^2/2 + \omega_1^4(\eta^n)^2/2 - \sigma_\times/k]\Big)
    \eta^{n-1}\\
    &+ \gamma^2k^2 I_l(x_\ctxt)\dxx\uln
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
This can then be used to calculate $F^n$ in \eqref{eq:1DwaveConnRigidForce} and can in turn be used to calculate $u_l^{n+1}$ in \eqref{eq:1DwaveConnRigid}.

\section{String-plate connection}\label{sec:stringPlateConnection}
In this example, let's consider a string connected to a plate using a nonlinear damped spring. This could be interpreted as a simplified form of how guitar string would be connected to the body. 

Extend section \ref{sec:interpolationSpreading} to 2D 

\subsection{Interpolation and spreading in 2D}\label{sec:interpolationSpreading2D}
One can extend the interpolation and spreading operators presented in Section \ref{sec:interpolationSpreading} to 2D by adding an additional argument to the operators \cite{theBible}. Using $l_\itxt = \floor[x_\itxt / h]$ and $m_\itxt = \floor[y_\itxt / h]$, a $0$\thOrder interpolation operator $I_0(x_\itxt, y_\itxt) = I_{(l, m), 0}(x_\itxt, y_\itxt)$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    I_0(x_\itxt, y_\itxt) = \begin{cases}
        1, & \text{if } l = l_\itxt \text{ and } m = m_\itxt,\\
        0, & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Notice that the same value for the grid spacing $h$ is used for both the $x$ and $y$ direction.

Using the fractional part of the flooring operations $\alpha_x = x_\itxt/h - l_\itxt$ and $\alpha_y= y_\itxt/h - m_\itxt$, a 2D linear interpolator  $I_1(x_\itxt, y_\itxt) = I_{(l, m), 1}(x_\itxt, y_\itxt)$ can then be composed of two 1D linear interpolators as
\begin{equation}
    I_1(x_\itxt, y_\itxt) = \begin{cases}
        (1 - \alpha_x)(1 - \alpha_y)& \text{if } l = l_\itxt \text{ and } m = m_\itxt, \\
        (1 - \alpha_x)\alpha_y& \text{if } l = l_\itxt \text{ and } m = m_\itxt + 1, \\
        \alpha_x(1 - \alpha_y)& \text{if } l = l_\itxt + 1 \text{ and } m = m_\itxt, \\
        \alpha_x\alpha_y& \text{if } l = l_\itxt+1 \text{ and } m = m_\itxt+1, \\
        0, & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Continuous}
The systems in isolation are as in \eqref{eq:stiffStringPDE} and \eqref{eq:platePDE}, but with an added force term:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:connStringPlatePDEs}
\begin{align}
    \ptt u &= c^2 \pxx u - \kappa_\stxt^2 \pxxxx u - 2\szX[\stxt]\pt u + 2\soX[\stxt] \pt\pxx u - \delta(x-x_\ctxt)\frac{f}{\rho_\stxt A}\\
   \ptt w &= -\kappa_\ptxt^2\Delta\Delta w - 2\szX[\ptxt]\pt w + 2\soX[\ptxt] \pt\pxx w + \delta(x-x_\ctxt, y-y_\ctxt)\frac{f}{ \rho_\ptxt H}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where
\begin{equation}
    f = f(t) = K_1\eta+K_3\eta^3+R \dot\eta
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \eta = \eta(t) = u(x_\ctxt, t) - w(x_\ctxt, y_\ctxt, t)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Discrete}
System \eqref{eq:connStringPlatePDEs} can then be discretised as
\begin{align}\label{eq:connStringPlateFDSs}
    \!\!\!\dtt \uln &= c^2 \dxx \uln - \kappa_\stxt^2 \dxxxx \uln - 2\szX[\stxt]\dtd \uln + 2\soX[\stxt] \dtm\dxx \uln - J_\stxt(x_\ctxt)\frac{f^n}{\rho_\stxt A}\ ,\\
    \!\!\!\dtt \wlmn &= -\kappa_\ptxt^2\dDelta\dDelta \wlmn - 2\szX[\ptxt]\dtd \wlmn + 2\soX[\ptxt] \dtm\dxx \wlmn + J_\ptxt(x_\ctxt, y_\ctxt)\frac{f^n}{ \rho_\ptxt H}\ ,
\end{align}
where $J_\text{s}(x_\ctxt) = J_l(x_\ctxt)$, $J_\text{p}(x_\ctxt) = J_{l, m}(x_\ctxt)$, and
\begin{equation}
    f^n = K_1\mtt\eta^n+K_3(\eta^n)^2\mtd\eta^n+R\dtd\eta^n,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \eta^n = I(x_\ctxt)\uln - I(x_\ctxt, y_\ctxt)\wln.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Expansion}
System \eqref{eq:connStringPlateFDSs} can be expanded at the connection location $x_\ctxt$ by taking an inner product of the schemes with their respective spreading operators. 


\subsection{Solving for $f$}


\subsection{Non-dimensional}
The scaled system can be written as:
\begin{align}
    \ptt u &= \gamma^2 \pxx u - \kappa_\stxt^2 \pxxxx u - 2\szX[\stxt]\pt u + 2\soX[\stxt] \pt\pxx u - \delta(x-x_\ctxt)F\\
   \pt w &= -\kappa_\ptxt^2\Delta\Delta w - 2\szX[\ptxt]\pt w + 2\soX[\ptxt] \pt\pxx w + \delta(x-x_\ctxt, y-y_\ctxt)F
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
    F = F(t) = \omega_1^2\eta+\omega_3^4\eta^3+\sigma_\ctxt \dot\eta
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \eta = \eta(t) = u(x_\ctxt, t) - w(x_\ctxt, y_\ctxt, t)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    I(x_\ctxt)\delta_{tt}\uln = c^2
    \left(I(x_\ctxt)\dxx\uln\right) + I(x_\ctxt)J(x_\ctxt)F
\end{equation}
