\chapter{Collisions}\label{ch:collisions}
Many musical instruments rely on collisions in some shape or form. Examples are the collision between a hammer and a piano string, a guitar pick and the string, and even the collision between the lips of a trumpet player. 

This work uses collision models that rely on penalising methods. The colliding objects -- although possibly perfectly rigid -- are supposed to interpenetrate, and collision is interpreted as a \textit{penalty}. The eventual force acting on the colliding objects is then dependent on the level of penetration. For deformable objects, such as the hammer felt tip of a piano, the penalty is dependent on the level of deformation. These collision models were first used in a musical context by e.g. \cite{Chatziioannou2013, Bilbao2014}.

The discretisations proposed in \cite{Chatziioannou2013, Bilbao2014} rely on implicit nonlinear schemes which require an iterative method, such as the Newton-Raphson method presented in Section \ref{sec:newtonRaphson}, to obtain their solution. 
The exact number of iterations required per time step, especially in interactive applications, is usually unknown. This could be detrimental to real-time applications, as the number of iterations, and consequently the extra number of computations, could be very large in a particular situation. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, existence and uniqueness of the solution might not be available. 

In \cite{Ducceschi2021} (co-authored by the PhD student [\hyperref[ch:listOfPublications]{O3}]), Ducceschi et al. propose a method based on quadratisation of the collision potential energy, that circumvents the need of an iterative method to solve nonlinear collisions. Energy quadratisation for explicit schemes first appeared in the context of Port-Hamiltonian systems and was due to Lopes et al. in \cite{Lopes2015}. The introduction of an additional state variable, which is what Ducceschi's work is based on, was introduced in \cite{Yang2017, Jiang2019}. Papers \citeP[D] and \citeP[E] follow an earlier iteration of the non-iterative collision algorithm from \cite{Ducceschi2019, Bilbao2019} which exhibited spurious oscillations that Ducceschi et al. resolve in \cite{Ducceschi2021}. Paper \citeP[H] uses the corrected collision model for the collision between the lips exciting the trombone. The corrected model will be used in this work and presented in this chapter. 

This chapter first provides a definition for the collision potential as well as its quadratisation, used as the basis for the explicit method. Then, the method will be applied to a simple mass-barrier collision and finally, to a mass-spring -- string collision which can be used to model a finger-fretted string.

\subsubsection{Collision potential}
Collisions can be modelled using a nonlinear \textit{collision potential}, which can be defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:potential}
    \phi(\eta) = \frac{K_\ctxt}{\alpha_\ctxt+1}[\eta]_+^{\alpha_\ctxt+1},
\end{equation}
with collision stiffness $K_\ctxt \geq 0$ (in N/m$^{\alpha_\ctxt}$) and dimensionless nonlinear collision coefficient $\alpha_\ctxt \geq 1$. Here $\eta = \eta(t)$ describes the relative displacement between the two colliding bodies (in m). The $[\cdot ]_+$ operator, defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:etaPlus}
    [\cdot]_+ = \frac{\cdot + |\cdot|}{2},
\end{equation}
describes the `positive part of' and when applied to $\eta$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:potential} causes the potential $\phi$ to only be non-zero when the two colliding bodies are in contact. 
% See Figure \ref{fig:eta}.

% \begin{figure}[h]
% \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{figures/interactions/eta.eps}}
% \caption{\label{fig:eta}{A plot of $[\eta]_+$.}}
% \end{figure}

The derivative of Eq. \eqref{eq:potential} with respect to $\eta$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:derivPotential}
    \phi'(\eta) = K_\ctxt[\eta]_+^{\alpha_\ctxt}
\end{equation}
and can then be used in the PDE at hand. 

The issue with this form of the collision potential, is that an iterative method, such as Newton-Raphson presented in Section \ref{sec:newtonRaphson}, needs to be used in order to solve the system \cite{Ducceschi2021}.

\subsubsection{Quadratic form}
In \cite{Ducceschi2021}, the authors propose to rewrite the potential in Eq. \eqref{eq:derivPotential} in a quadratic form. Using the chain rule and  $\psi = \psi(\eta)$, Eq. \eqref{eq:derivPotential} can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:quadraticPotential}
    \phi'(\eta) = \psi\psi' \quad \text{where} \quad \psi = \sqrt{2\phi} \quad \text{and} \quad \psi' = \frac{\dot{\psi}}{\dot{\eta}}\ ,
\end{equation}
where a dot denotes a single derivative with respect to time. 

This form of the potential can be discretised to a FD scheme that can be solved explicitly. This process will be shown below, using an example of the simple mass -- rigid barrier collision. 

\section{The mass -- rigid barrier collision}\label{sec:massRigidBarrier}
As a test case, a mass colliding with a rigid barrier is presented here, which is arguably the simplest case of a collision. Consider a mass at location $u = u(t)$ (in m) colliding with a barrier at location $b$ (in m).

If the barrier is placed above the mass, the force it exerts on the mass will be negative and its system would be described as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:massBarrierPre}
    M\ddot u = -\psi\psi',
\end{equation}
with mass $M$ (in kg) and $\psi = \psi(\eta)$ and $\psi'$ are as defined in Eq. \eqref{eq:quadraticPotential} with $\eta = \eta(t) = u(t) - b$. 

Looking towards the discretisation the mass-barrier collision, one could use the definitions in Eq. \eqref{eq:quadraticPotential} to rewrite Eq. \eqref{eq:massBarrierPre} to the following system of equations
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:massBarrier}
    \begin{align}
        M\ddot u &= -\psi g,\label{eq:massBarrierPDE1}\\
        \dot\psi &= g \dot\eta,\label{eq:massBarrierPDE2}\\
        \eta(t) &= u(t) - b,\label{eq:massBarrierPDE3}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations} 
where $g = \psi'$.

\subsubsection{Relative location of objects}
When working with multiple interacting objcts, it is important to consider whether an object is located `above' or `below' the other, 
%
% Notice that 
% it is important to keep in mind the relative location of the colliding objects, i.e., whether one object is `above' or `below' an other. 
i.e., which (generally) has a more positive or negative displacement than the other. A mass with a displacement of $0.01$ m will thus be `above' a barrier with a displacement of $-0.05$ m. Along these lines, a positive force acting on an element will accelerate it upwards and a negative force will accelerate it downwards.

The relative location of the two colliding objects will affect two things in system \eqref{eq:massBarrier}:

Firstly, the location of the object determines the direction of the collision force, i.e., the sign of the right-hand side in system \eqref{eq:massBarrier}. In this case, the barrier is placed above the mass, and will exert a downwards (negative) force on the mass during collision. If the barrier was placed below the mass, the opposite would have applied.

Secondly, the definition of $\eta$ in \eqref{eq:massBarrierPDE3} is affected by the relative location of the objects. The collision potential in Eq. \eqref{eq:potential} is only non-zero when $\eta$ is positive. If the barrier is placed above the mass, $u(t)-b$ will be positive on collision. It is thus important to remember that $\eta$ should be defined as the element above subtracted from the element below.

\subsection{Discrete time}
Before discretising system \eqref{eq:massBarrier} in full, the discrete approximation to the collision potential will be elaborated on.
Following \cite{Ducceschi2021}, $\psi$ is placed on an interleaved temporal grid (see Section \ref{sec:firstOrderDiscrete}) using
\begin{equation}\label{eq:psiHalfDef}
    \psi^{n-1/2} = \mu_{t-}\psi^n,
\end{equation} 
where the interleaved temporal grid is used here as it results in energy conservation in discrete time (see Section \ref{sec:energyAnalysisMassBarrier}). Approximations to $\psi$ and $g$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:massBarrier} can then be made as 
\begin{equation}
    \psi \approxeq \mtp \psi^{n-1/2}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:approxPsi}
    g \approxeq g^n = \frac{\delta_{t+}\psi^{n-1/2}}{\delta_{t\cdot}\eta^n} ,
\end{equation}
respectively. Notice that applying a first-order difference operator to a grid function on an interleaved grid is second-order accurate.\footnote{$\ \dtp \psi^{n-1/2}\ \overset{\text{Eq. \eqref{eq:approxPsi}}}{=}\ \dtp \mtm \psi^n\ \overset{\text{Eq. \eqref{eq:identity2}}}{=}\  \dtd \psi^n$ which is second-order accurate (see Section \ref{sec:FDoperators}).}
The result of the approximation in Eq. \eqref{eq:approxPsi} allows $\psi$ to be treated as an independent time series:
\begin{equation}
    \dtp \psi^{n-1/2} = g^n \dtd \eta^n.
\end{equation}
With the above approximations in place, system \eqref{eq:massBarrier} can be discretised and yields the following system of equations: 
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:massBarrierSystem}
    \begin{align}
        M\dtt \un &= -\left(\mtp\psi^{n-1/2}\right)g^n,\label{eq:massBarrierSystem1}\\
        \dtp \psi^{n-1/2} &= g^n \dtd \eta^n,\label{eq:massBarrierSystem2}\\ 
        \eta^n &= \un - b.\label{eq:massBarrierSystem3}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}


\subsubsection{An explicit definition for $g^n$}
To be able to calculate $\psi^{n+1/2}$ and $u^{n+1}$ in system \eqref{eq:massBarrierSystem} explicitly, a definition for $g^n$ only based on known values must be found. As $g^n \approxeq \psi'$ as per Eq. \eqref{eq:approxPsi}, the derivative can be computed analytically according to 
\begin{equation}
    g^n = \psi'\bigg\rvert_{\eta=\eta^n} \quad \overset{\text{Eq. \eqref{eq:quadraticPotential}}}{=}\quad  \frac{\phi'}{\sqrt{2\phi}}\bigg\rvert_{\eta=\eta^n}.
\end{equation}
Recalling \eqref{eq:derivPotential} and \eqref{eq:potential}, this can conveniently be rewritten to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gn}
    g^n = \frac{K_\ctxt[\eta^n]_+^{\alpha_\ctxt}}{\sqrt{\frac{2K_\ctxt}{\alpha_\ctxt+1}[\eta^n]_+^{\alpha_\ctxt+1}}}=K_\ctxt\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_\ctxt+1}{2K_\ctxt}}[\eta^n]_+^{\alpha_\ctxt}[\eta^n]_+^{\frac{-(\alpha_\ctxt+1)}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{K_\ctxt(\alpha_\ctxt+1)}{2}}[\eta^n]_+^{\frac{\alpha_\ctxt-1}{2}}\,.
\end{equation}
For implementation purposes, one can expand the $[\cdot]_+$ operator as the following (equivalent) condition:
\begin{subnumcases}{ \label{eq:gDefOld} g^n =}
    \sqrt{\frac{K_\text{c}(\alpha_\text{c}+1)}{2}}\cdot(\eta^n)^{\frac{\alpha_\text{c}-1}{2}},
    & if $\eta^n \geq 0$ \label{eq:collCorr1Old}\\
    0, & $\text{if } \eta^n < 0$\label{eq:collCorr2Old}
\end{subnumcases}
This implementation is the one presented in \cite{Ducceschi2019}, but exhibited spurious oscillations and `sticking' behaviour. This is due to the possibility of negative forces for positive penetrations due to the discontinuity in the definition for $g^n$ at $\eta^n = 0$.

In \cite{Ducceschi2021}, the definition for $g^n$ in \eqref{eq:gDefOld} is extended, starting out by using an implicit equation for $g^n$ by directly discretising Eq. \eqref{eq:approxPsi}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gImp}
    g_\text{imp}^n = 2\frac{\psi^{n+1/2} - \psi^{n-1/2}}{\eta^{n+1} - \eta^{n-1}}\ .
\end{equation}
If there is, however, no collision at $n+1/2$, $\psi^{n+1/2} = 0$ and Eq. \eqref{eq:gImp} reduces to
\begin{equation*}
    g_\text{imp}^n = -2\frac{\psi^{n-1/2}}{\eta^{n+1} - \eta^{n-1}}\ .
\end{equation*}
Furthermore, due to the fact that there is no collision, $\eta^{n+1}$ can be calculated according to $\eta^{n+1} = \eta^\star = u^\star - b$, where $u^\star$ is the value of $u^{n+1}$ calculated using the scheme in Eq. \eqref{eq:massBarrierSystem1} without the collision force. Expanding Eq. \eqref{eq:massBarrierSystem1} without the collision force yields  
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{M}{k^2}\left(u^\star - 2\un + u^{n-1}\right) = 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad u^\star = 2u^n - u^{n-1}.
\end{equation*}
Thus, if there is no collision, $g^n_\text{imp}$ can now be explicitly calculated from known values and be used in the definition for $g^n$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:gDefOld} according to \cite{Ducceschi2021}
\begin{subnumcases}{ \label{eq:gDef} g^n =}
    \kappa\sqrt{\frac{K_\text{c}(\alpha_\text{c}+1)}{2}}\cdot(\eta^n)^{\frac{\alpha_\text{c}-1}{2}},
    & if $\eta^n \geq 0,$ \label{eq:collCorr1}\\
    -2 \frac{\psi^{n-1/2}}{\eta^\star-\eta^{n-1}}, & if $\eta^n < 0\ \text{ and } \ \eta^{\star} \neq \eta^{n-1},$\label{eq:collCorr2}\\
    0, & $\text{if } \eta^n < 0\ \text{ and } \ \eta^{\star} = \eta^{n-1}.\qquad$\label{eq:collCorr3}
\end{subnumcases}
%
Here, $\kappa = 1$ if $\psi^{n-1/2} \geq 0$, otherwise $\kappa = -1$ and aims to resolve the `sticking' behaviour by forcing an outwardly-directed force at all times. As was done in paper \citeP[H], condition \eqref{eq:collCorr3} has been added to the definition of $g^n$ from \cite{Ducceschi2021} to prevent a division by 0 in Eq. \eqref{eq:collCorr2}. 

This definition for $g^n$ does not exhibit the spurious oscillations that the old definition in Eq. \eqref{eq:gDefOld} did, and can still be explicitly calculated from known values of the system. 

\subsection{Solving the system}\label{sec:solvingMassBarrier}
To implement the system in Eq. \eqref{eq:massBarrierSystem}, its definitions need to be slightly rewritten. Using identity \eqref{eq:identity3}, $\mtp \psi^{n-1/2}$ can be rewritten to
\begin{equation*}
    \mu_{t+}\psi^{n-1/2} = \frac{k}{2}\delta_{t+}\psi^{n-1/2} + \psi^{n-1/2}.
\end{equation*}
Then, substituting \eqref{eq:massBarrierSystem2} into this, yields
\begin{equation}\nonumber
    \mu_{t+}\psi^{n-1/2} = \frac{k}{2}g^n\delta_{t\cdot}\eta^n + \psi^{n-1/2},
\end{equation}
and inserting this into \eqref{eq:massBarrierSystem1}, yields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:substitutionFDS}
    M\delta_{tt}u^n = -\left(\frac{k}{2}g^n\delta_{t\cdot}\eta^n + \psi^{n-1/2}\right)g^n\ .
\end{equation}
As the position of barrier $b$ is static, the following is true:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:derEtaEqDerU}
    \frac{d\eta}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\Big(u - b\Big)\quad \Longrightarrow \quad \delta_{t\cdot}\eta^n = \delta_{t\cdot}u^n,
\end{equation}
i.e., the time derivative of $\eta$ equals the time derivative of $u$.\footnote{Note that if the barrier was placed underneath the mass, making \eqref{eq:massBarrierSystem3} $\eta^n = b-u^n$, this would result in $\delta_{t_\cdot}\eta^n = -\delta_{t\cdot}u^n$.} Eq. \eqref{eq:substitutionFDS} can now be solved explicitly as $u^{n+1}$ is the only unknown in the system
\begin{equation}
    \bigg(\frac{M}{k^2} + \frac{(g^n)^2}{4}\bigg)u^{n+1} = \frac{M}{k^2}(2u^n-u^{n-1})+\frac{(g^n)^2}{4}u^{n-1}-\psi^{n-1/2}g^n\ ,
\end{equation}
and can be solved by a simple division. 

Finally, $u^{n+1}$ can be used to calculate $\eta^{n+1}$ by evaluating \eqref{eq:massBarrierSystem3} at $n+1$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:etaNPlus1}
    \eta^{n+1} = u^{n+1}-b,
\end{equation}
which is used to calculate $\psi^{n+1/2}$ by expanding and rewriting \eqref{eq:massBarrierSystem2} to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:psiNPlusHalf}
    \psi^{n+1/2} = \psi^{n-1/2} + \frac{\eta^{n+1} - \eta^{n-1}}{2}\ .
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:massBarrierCollision} shows the mass -- rigid barrier collision over time for two values of $K_\text{c}$. The mass is initialised with an initial (upwards) velocity using $u^0 = -1$ m and $u^1 = -0.95$ m. The figure shows that the penetration of the mass with the barrier causes a downwards force on the mass. As expected, this force is higher for a larger value of $K_\ctxt$ and causes the mass to accelerate downwards more quickly.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Energy analysis}\label{sec:energyAnalysisMassBarrier}
To prove that the collision term does not add any additional energy into the system (retaining passivity) and that it does not add additional constraints on the stability of the system, the energy analysis techniques presented in Section \ref{sec:energyAnalysis} can be used. Notice that for brevity, the steps presented in Section \ref{sec:energyAnalysis} will not explicitly be followed.

Multiplying Eq. \eqref{eq:massBarrierSystem1} by $(\dtd \un)$ yields 
\begin{equation*}
    \dtp \h_\mtxt  = -\left(\mtp\psi^{n-1/2}\right)g^n (\dtd \un)
\end{equation*}
where the energy of the mass is defined as (see Eq. \eqref{eq:energyBalanceMassSpring})
\begin{equation}
    \h_\mtxt = \frac{M}{2}(\dtm\un)^2.
\end{equation}
Expanding $g^n$ yields 
\begin{align*}
    \dtp \h_\mtxt  &= -\left(\mtp\psi^{n-1/2}\right)\frac{\dtp \psi^{n-1/2}}{\dtd \eta^n}(\dtd \un)\\
    \xLeftrightarrow{\mystrut\ \text{Eq. \eqref{eq:derEtaEqDerU}}} \qquad & = -\left(\mtp\psi^{n-1/2}\right)\dtp \psi^{n-1/2},
\end{align*}
which, using identity \eqref{eq:prodIdentity3}, can be rewritten to 
\begin{equation}
    \dtp(\h_\mtxt + \h_\ctxt) = 0,
\end{equation}
with collision energy
\begin{equation}\label{eq:collisionEnergy}
    \h_\ctxt = \frac{(\psi^{n-1/2})^2}{2}.
\end{equation}
Recall that in order for a scheme to be passive, its energy must be non-negative, and the fact that $\psi$ is squared proves passivity for system \eqref{eq:massBarrierSystem}.

Figure \ref{fig:massBarrierEnergy} shows the energetic output of the mass -- rigid barrier collision corresponding to Figure \ref{fig:massBarrierLow}. The left panel shows that the kinetic energy of the mass is transferred into the energy of the collision, after which it is converted into kinetic energy of the mass again.

\end{figure}

\section{Mass-spring -- string collision}\label{sec:massString}
The mass-spring -- string collision is slightly trickier than the mass -- rigid barrier collision, as there are two moving components rather than one. This system is chosen as an example as it has the interesting use-case of fretting a string to change the pitch, modelling the fretting finger as a mass.

Consider a lossless stiff string of length $L$, its transverse displacement described by $u = u(x,t)$ (in m) and defined for $t\geq 0$ and $x\in \D$ with domain $\D = [0, L]$. The mass with displacement $w = w(t)$ (in m) and $t\geq 0$ will model the fretting finger. The PDE for the stiff string and its parameter definitions can be found in Eq. \eqref{eq:stiffStringPDENoLosses} and for the mass-spring system in Eq. \eqref{eq:massSpringPDE}. Placing the string above the mass, the following system emerges:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:massStringPDE}
\begin{align}   
    \rho A \ptt u & =T\pxx u - EI\pxxxx u + \delta(x-x_\text{m}) \psi g \label{eq:massStringPDE1}\\
    M \ddot w &=-Kw - \psi g\label{eq:massStringPDE2}\\
    \dot\psi &= g \dot\eta,\label{eq:massStringPDE3}\\
    \eta(t) &= w(t) - u(x_\text{m}, t),\label{eq:massStringPDE4}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where spatial Dirac delta function $\delta(x-x_\text{m})$ localises the mass (finger) along the string at location $x_\text{m} \in \D$ (see Eq. \eqref{eq:spatialDirac}). Furthermore, $\psi = \psi(\eta)$ and $g=\psi'$ are as defined in Eq. \eqref{eq:quadraticPotential}. 

Discretising system \eqref{eq:massStringPDE}, with the collision discretised according to the process explained in Section \ref{sec:massRigidBarrier}, yields
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}   
        \rho A \delta_{tt}u^n_l & =T\delta_{xx}u^n_l - EI\delta_{xxxx}u_l^n + J_l(x_\text{m}) \big(\mu_{t+}\psi^{n-1/2}\big)g^n, \label{eq:massString1}\\
        M \delta_{tt}w^n &=-Kw^n - \big(\mu_{t+}\psi^{n-1/2}\big)g^n,\label{eq:massString2}\\
        \delta_{t+}\psi^{n-1/2} &= g^n\delta_{t\cdot}\eta^n,\label{eq:massString3}\\
        \eta^n &= w^n - I_l(x_\text{m})\uln,\label{eq:massString4}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $l\in d$ with discrete domain $d=\{0, \hdots, N\}$ and number of grid points along the string $N+1$. Furthermore, spreading and interpolation operators $I_l(x_\text{m}) = I_{l, o}(x_\text{m})$ and $J_l(x_\text{m}) = J_{l, o}(x_\text{m})$ are as defined in Section \ref{sec:interpolationSpreading}. The order $o$ is left unspecified. Following the same process as in Section \ref{sec:solvingMassBarrier}, Eqs. \eqref{eq:massString1} and \eqref{eq:massString2} can be rewritten to 
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:massStringComb}
    \begin{align}
        \rho A \delta_{tt}u^n_l & =T\delta_{xx}u^n_l - EI\delta_{xxxx}u_l^n + J_l(x_\text{m}) \left(\frac{k}{2}g^n\delta_{t\cdot}\eta^n + \psi^{n-1/2}\right)g^n,\label{eq:massStringComb1}\\
        M \delta_{tt}w^n &=-Kw^n - \left(\frac{k}{2}g^n\delta_{t\cdot}\eta^n + \psi^{n-1/2}\right)g^n,\label{eq:massStringComb2}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
which can be used as a starting point for solving the system.

\subsection{Solving the system}
As the colliding objects are both moving, Eq. \eqref{eq:derEtaEqDerU} is not valid anymore and another strategy needs to be used.
To start, one must isolate the string at the collision location $x_\text{m}$ by taking an inner product of Eq. \eqref{eq:massStringComb1} with $J_l(x_\text{m})$ over discrete domain $d$. Using identity \eqref{eq:identityIJ} and dividing all terms by $\rho A$ yields
\begin{align*}
    \delta_{tt}I_l(x_\text{m})u^n_l =c^2I_l(x_\text{m})\delta_{xx}u^n_l &- \kappa^2I_l(x_\text{m})\delta_{xxxx}u_l^n \\
    &\quad + \frac{\lVert J_l(x_\text{m})\rVert^2_d}{\rho A} \left(\frac{k}{2}g^n\delta_{t\cdot}\eta^n + \psi^{n-1/2}\right)g^n.
\end{align*}
with $c = \sqrt{T/\rho A}$ and $\kappa = \sqrt{EI/\rho A}$. Expanding the temporal FD operators yields 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stringMassunp1}
    I_l(x_\text{m})u_l^{n+1} = u^\star+ \underbrace{\frac{\lVert J_l(x_\text{m})\rVert^2_d k^2}{\rho A}}_{\mathfrak{J}_l} \left(\frac{(g^n)^2}{4}\left(\eta^{n+1}-\eta^{n-1}\right) + \psi^{n-1/2}g^n\right),
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation*}
    u^\star = I_l(x_\text{m})(2u_l^n -u_l^{n-1}) + c^2k^2I_l(x_\text{m})\delta_{xx}\uln- \kappa^2k^2I_l(x_\text{m})\delta_{xxxx}\uln
\end{equation*}
is the result of the update equation of the string at $x_\text{m}$ without the collision term. Then, Eq. \eqref{eq:massString4} evaluated at $n+1$, which is $\eta^{n+1} = w^{n+1} - I(x_\text{m})u_l^{n+1}$, can be substituted into Eq. \eqref{eq:stringMassunp1}, which results in
\begin{equation}\label{eq:expandedMassString1}
    \begin{aligned}
    \left(1 + \mathfrak{J}_l\frac{(g^n)^2}{4}\right)I_l(x_\text{m})u_l^{n+1} - \mathfrak{J}_l&\frac{(g^n)^2}{4} w^{n+1}= u^\star\\
    & + \mathfrak{J}_l \left(-\frac{(g^n)^2}{4}\eta^{n-1} + \psi^{n-1/2}g^n\right).
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Performing this same process on the FD scheme of the mass in Eq. \eqref{eq:massStringComb2} yields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:expandedMassString2}
    \begin{aligned}
    -\frac{(g^n)^2 k^2}{4M} I_l(x_\text{m})u_l^{n+1} + &\left(1 + \frac{(g^n)^2 k^2}{4M}\right)w^{n+1} = w^\star\\
    & - \frac{k^2}{M} \left(-\frac{(g^n)^2}{4}\eta^{n-1} + \psi^{n-1/2}g^n\right),
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation*}
    w^\star = 2w^n - w^{n-1} - \frac{Kk^2}{M}w^n
\end{equation*}
is (again) the result of the update equation of the mass without the collision term.
Equations \eqref{eq:expandedMassString1} and \eqref{eq:expandedMassString2} can be treated as a system of linear equations (see Section \ref{sec:linearEquations}) with unknowns $I_l(x_\text{m})u^{n+1}$ and $w^{n+1}$. Writing the aforementioned equations in matrix form yields
\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
            I_l(x_\text{m})u^{n+1}_l\\
            w^{n+1}
        \end{bmatrix}
        = 
        \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{v}
    \end{align}
    where
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{gathered}
    \mathbf{A} = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \left(1 + \mathfrak{J}_l\frac{(g^n)^2}{4}\right) & -\mathfrak{J}_l\frac{(g^n)^2}{4}\\
            -\frac{(g^n)^2 k^2}{4M} &\left(1 + \frac{(g^n)^2 k^2}{4M}\right)
        \end{bmatrix}
        \quad \text{and}\\
        \mathbf{v} = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
            u^\star + \mathfrak{J}_l \left(-\frac{(g^n)^2}{4}\eta^{n-1} + \psi^{n-1/2}g^n\right)\\
            w^\star- \frac{k^2}{M} \left(-\frac{(g^n)^2}{4}\eta^{n-1} + \psi^{n-1/2}g^n\right)
        \end{bmatrix}.
        \nonumber
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
From this, $\eta^{n+1}$ can be calculated, and can consequently be applied to the string and mass in system \eqref{eq:massStringComb}.

Figure \ref{fig:massStringCollision} shows an implementation of the mass spring collision. The mass is initialised with an upwards initial velocity, where $w^0 = -0.2, w^1 = -0.1$, and collides with the string almost instantly after the start of the simulation. As the first panel shows, the collision model allows for interpenetration of the objects. Immediately after, the collision force accelerates the string upwards and the mass downwards.

    \caption{The collision of the mass (blue) and the string (red). The collision model allows for interpenetration of the objects as shown in the left panel. \label{fig:massStringCollision}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Energy analysis}
This section follows Section \ref{sec:energyAnalysis} without explicitly following the steps for brevity. 

One can obtain the energy of the stiff string FD scheme in Eq. \eqref{eq:massString1} by taking the inner product of scheme by $(\dtd \uln)$ over discrete domain $d$ to obtain 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rOCEnergyString}
    \dtp \h_\text{s} = \left\langle (\dtd \uln), J_l(x_\text{m})\left(\mtp \psi^{n-1/2}\right)g^n\right\rangle_d
\end{equation}
where the energy of the string is (see Eq. \eqref{eq:energyBalanceStiffString})
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{gathered}
        \h_\text{s} = \t_\text{s} + \v_\text{s}, \qwiq \t_\text{s} = \frac{\rho A}{2}\lVert\dtm \uln\rVert^2_d,\quad \text{and} \\
        \v_\text{s} = \frac{T}{2}\langle\dxp\uln, e_{t-}\dxp\uln\rangle_{\underline{d}} + \frac{EI}{2}\langle\dxx\uln, e_{t-}\dxx\uln\rangle_{\overline{\underline{d}}}\ .
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation*}
Energy analysis for the mass in Eq. \eqref{eq:massString2} can be done by multiplying the scheme by $(\dtd w^n)$ to get 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rOCEnergyMass}
    \dtp \h_\text{m} = -(\dtd w^n)\left(\mtp \psi^{n-1/2}\right)g^n,
\end{equation}
where (see Eq. \eqref{eq:energyBalanceMassSpring})
\begin{equation*}
    \h_\text{m} = \t_\text{m} + \v_\text{m}, \qwiq \t_\text{m} = \frac{M}{2}(\dtm w^n)^2, \qaq \v_\text{m} = \frac{K}{2}w^n e_{t-}w^n.
\end{equation*}
The total energy in the system is the addition of Eqs. \eqref{eq:rOCEnergyString} and \eqref{eq:rOCEnergyMass}, which, using identity \eqref{eq:identityIJ} for the former, can be written as:
\begin{align*}
    \dtp(\h_\text{s} + \h_\text{m}) &= \Big(I_l(x_\text{m})(\dtd \uln) - (\dtd w^n)\Big)\left(\mtp \psi^{n-1/2}\right)g^n,\\
    &= \underbrace{\dtd\left(I_l(x_\text{m})\uln - w^n\right)}_{-\dtd \eta^n}\left(\mtp \psi^{n-1/2}\right)g^n.
\end{align*}
Then, expanding $g^n$ according to Eq. \eqref{eq:approxPsi} yields 
\begin{align*}
    \dtp(\h_\text{s} + \h_\text{m}) &= - \dtd\eta^n\left(\mtp \psi^{n-1/2}\right)\frac{\delta_{t+}\psi^{n-1/2}}{\delta_{t\cdot}\eta^n}\\
    &= -\left(\mtp \psi^{n-1/2}\right)\delta_{t+}\psi^{n-1/2}
\end{align*}
which, using identity \eqref{eq:prodIdentity3}, can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
    \dtp(\h_\text{s} + \h_\text{m} + \h_\text{c}) = 0,
\end{equation}
with collision energy
\begin{equation*}
    \h_\text{c} = \frac{(\psi^{n-1/2})^2}{2}.
\end{equation*}
Again, the fact that $\psi$ is squared here, means that $\h_\text{c}$ is non-negative, and proves passivity of the system. 

Figure \ref{fig:massStringCollisionEnergy} shows the energy of the mass-spring collision corresponding to the behaviour shown in Figure \ref{fig:massStringCollision}. One can observe that energy of the mass is transferred to the string almost immediately after the start of the simulation. Furthermore, the figure shows that the mass and the string collide again at $n\approx 110$. The interpenetration of the two colliding objects can be observed from the small peaks in the value for $\h_\ctxt$ at these times.

\section{Two-sided collision: A connection}\label{sec:twoSidedCollision}

% As an alternative to the method connections shown in Chapter \ref{ch:connections} showed ways to connect various resonators using techniques presented in \cite{theBible}. An alternative method to establish these connections can be devised using the methods presented in this chapter.
% 

Using the methods presented in this chapter, one could devise a two-sided collision and alter the collision potential in Eq. \eqref{eq:potential} to \cite{Bilbao2019}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:twoSidedPotential}
    \phi(\eta) = \frac{K}{\alpha_\ctxt+1}|\eta|^{\alpha_\ctxt+1},
\end{equation}
and taking its derivative with respect to $\eta$ yields
\begin{equation}
    \phi'(\eta) = \sgn(\eta)K|\eta|^{\alpha_\ctxt}.
\end{equation}
One can observe that, as opposed to the (one-sided) potential presented in Eq. \eqref{eq:potential}, the collision force will be non-zero, for both a positive and negative $\eta$. This two-sided collision can be used as a connection -- as an alternative to connections presented in Chapter \ref{ch:connections} -- and has been used in papers \citeP[D] and \citeP[E] in combination with Eq. \eqref{eq:potential} to model the mechanics of the tromba marina. See Chapter \ref{ch:tromba} for more details.
