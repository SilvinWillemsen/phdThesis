\chapter*{Interactions}
The models described in Part \ref{part:resonators} can already sound quite convincing on their own. 

Part \ref{part:resonators} introduced various resonators in isolation. Most musical instruments are composed of several individual systems which all interact with one another. The following chapters will describe different ways of interaction between individual resonators. Chapter \ref{ch:collisions} describes collision interactions between different systems and Chapter \ref{ch:connections} describes various to connections between models.
