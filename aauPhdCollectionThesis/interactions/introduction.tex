$\varepsilon$

Newtons third law (action reaction)

Subscripts are needed

Somewhere in this Chapter have a section about fretting and how to generate different pitches using only one string

The models described in Part \ref{part:resonators} already sound quite convincing on their own. However, these are just individual components that can be combined to approximate a fully functional (virtual) instrument. The following chapters will describe different ways of interaction between individual systems. Chapter \ref{ch:connections} describes ways to connect different systems and Chapter \ref{ch:collisions} describes collision interactions between models.
