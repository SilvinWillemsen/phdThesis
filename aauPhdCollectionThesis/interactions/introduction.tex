\chapter*{Interactions}
The models described in Part \ref{part:resonators} can already sound quite convincing on their own. However, most musical instruments are composed of a combination these individual resonators and need to be combined to approximate fully functional (virtual) instruments. The following chapters will describe different ways of interaction between individual systems. Chapter \ref{ch:connections} describes various to connect different systems and Chapter \ref{ch:collisions} describes collision interactions between models. \todo{COLLISION CONNECTION}
