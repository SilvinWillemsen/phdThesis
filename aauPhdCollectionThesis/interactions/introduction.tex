\chapter*{Interactions}
Part \ref{part:resonators} introduced various resonators in isolation. Most musical instruments are composed of several individual systems which all interact with one another. The following chapters will describe different ways of interaction between individual resonators. 

Chapter \ref{ch:collisions} describes collision interactions between different systems and has been used for the interactions between the different components of the tromba marina in papers \citeP[D] and \citeP[E]. Furthermore, the theory described in this chapter has been used for the collision between the lips that excite the trombone in paper \citeP[H]. Then, Chapter \ref{ch:connections} describes various to connections between models and has been used extensively for papers \citeP[A] and \citeP[B]. Furthermore, the dynamic grid presented in paper \citeP[G], uses the principles described in this chapter.
