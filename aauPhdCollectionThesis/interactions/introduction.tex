\chapter*{Interactions}
The models described in Part \ref{part:resonators} can already sound quite convincing on their own. 

Part \ref{part:resonators} introduced various resonators in isolation. Most musical instruments are composed of several individual systems which all interact with one another. The following chapters will describe different ways of interaction between individual resonators. Chapter \ref{ch:connections} describes various to connect different systems and Chapter \ref{ch:collisions} describes collision interactions between models. \todo{COLLISION CONNECTION}
