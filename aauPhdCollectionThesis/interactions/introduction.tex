\chapter*{Interactions}
Most musical instruments are composed of several individual resonators which interact with one another. Part \ref{part:resonators} introduced various resonators in isolation, and this part describes different ways to model the interaction between these. 

Chapter \ref{ch:collisions} describes collision interactions between different systems and has been used for the interactions between the different components of the tromba marina in papers \citeP[D] and \citeP[E]. Furthermore, the theory described in this chapter has been used for the collision between the lips that excite the trombone in paper \citeP[H]. Then, Chapter \ref{ch:connections} describes various to connections between models and has been used extensively for papers \citeP[A] and \citeP[B]. Furthermore, the dynamic grid presented in paper \citeP[G], uses the principles described in this chapter.
