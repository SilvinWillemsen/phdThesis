This part presents the contributions made throughout this PhD project.

It can be seen as an extended summary of the published work in \ref{part:papers}.

This part starts by introducing the dynamic grid in Chapter \ref{ch:dynamicGrid}, a method to dynamically vary grid configurations in FDTD simulations. After this, details on the real-time implementation will be given in Chapter \ref{ch:realtime} that have been used for most of the published work. 
Finally, several full instrument models that have been developed during the PhD will be presented. Chapter \ref{ch:largeScale} shows a three instrument-inspired case-studies using a large-scale modular environment, Chapter \ref{ch:tromba} describes the implementation of the tromba marina and Chapter \ref{ch:trombone} that of the trombone.
