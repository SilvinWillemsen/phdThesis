\chapter*{Contributions}
This part presents the contributions made throughout this PhD project, and can be seen as an extended summary of the published work in \ref{part:papers}. As much as possible, the summaries relate the content of the papers to the theory presented in the rest of the thesis. 

This part starts by introducing the dynamic grid in Chapter \ref{ch:dynamicGrid}, a method to dynamically vary grid configurations in FDTD simulations published in paper \citeP[G], and extends the paper by providing implementation details and design considerations. Chapter \ref{ch:realtime} provides details on real-time implementation of physical models using FDTD methods and has been for many of the contributions. 
Finally, several real-time implementations of full instrument models that have been developed during the PhD will be presented: Chapter \ref{ch:largeScale} provides an extended summary of papers \citeP[A] and \citeP[B], which presents three instrument-inspired case-studies using a large-scale modular environment. Chapter \ref{ch:tromba} summarises papers \citeP[D] and \citeP[E] presenting the tromba marina, and provides extra information on the implementation of the algorithm. Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:trombone} provides an extended summary of paper \citeP[H] and extends the paper by providing implementation details and design considerations.
