\chapter*{Contributions}
This part presents the contributions made throughout this PhD project, and can be seen as an extended summary of the published work in \ref{part:papers}. The summaries attempt to relate the content of the papers to the theory presented in the rest of the thesis. 

This part starts by introducing the dynamic grid in Chapter \ref{ch:dynamicGrid}, a method to dynamically vary grid configurations in FDTD simulations published in paper \citeP[G]. Chapter \ref{ch:realtime} provides details on real-time implementation of physical models using FDTD methods and has been for many of the contributions. 
Finally, several full instrument models that have been developed during the PhD will be presented. Chapter \ref{ch:largeScale} shows a three instrument-inspired case-studies using a large-scale modular environment, Chapter \ref{ch:tromba} describes the implementation of the tromba marina and Chapter \ref{ch:trombone} that of the trombone.
