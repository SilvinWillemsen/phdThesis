\chapter{The Tromba Marina}\label{ch:tromba}
This chapter provides an extended summary for the paper ``Real-time Implementation of a Physical Model of the Tromba Marina'' \citeP[D] and the paper ``Resurrecting the Tromba Marina: A Bowed Virtual Reality Instrument using Haptic Feedback and Accurate Physical Modelling'' \citeP[E]. After a general summary of these papers, the physical model will be summarised, with reference to the theory explained in the previous parts of this thesis. Finally, this chapter extends on the contents of paper \citeP[D] by providing more details on the implementation and goes through an energy analysis.

\section{Summary}
The tromba marina is a bowed monochord instrument from medieval Europe (see Figure 1 in paper \citeP[D]). It has a long quasi-trapezoidal body and is unique due to its oddly-shaped bridge that the string rests on. The bridge is often called a `shoe' due to its shape and is free to rattle against the body in sympathy with the movement of the vibrating string (see Figure 2 in paper \citeP[D]). This rattling causes a sound with brass or trumpet-like qualities, hence the name \textit{tromba} which stems from the Italian word trumpet. The rarity of the instrument as well as its interesting physics makes it an ideal case for a physical modelling implementation.

\subsubsection{Real-time implementation and control}
Paper \citeP[D] presents a physical model of the tromba marina and its real-time implementation. The application and a video showcasing it can be found online.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/SilvinWillemsen/TrombaMarina/releases/tag/2.0}}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{\url{https://youtu.be/x72Xh-nUoVc}} The paper uses the Sensel morph for control of the algorithm. See Section \ref{sec:sensel} for more information on this controller. To approach the interaction paradigm of the real-life instrument, a virtual reality (VR) application was made from where the algorithm could be controlled. To this end, the PHANTOM Omni haptic device was used to control the implementation and presented in paper \citeP[E]. See Section \ref{sec:phantomOmni} for more details on this device. A demo of the VR application can be found  online.\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlHqvaaPCyU}} The VR implementation has been evaluated and the results will be summarised below.

\subsubsection{Evaluation and results}
The VR implementation of the tromba marina was evaluated on 14 participants. The goals of the evaluation was to determine the general experience of bowing in a VR environment, and to evaluate the playability of a VR monochord instrument.
The data was collected using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods as detailed in paper \citeP[E]. The questions asked in the quantitative part of the evaluation were divided into haptics, visuals, audio, and overall experience of the application.

The results show that the various modalities (visuals, audio and haptics) seemed to reinforce each other and that the haptic feedback provided by the PHANTOM Omni was deemed ``realistic'' and ``natural''. The overall playability of the instrument was thus concluded to be satisfactory, though improvements could be made.

\section{Physical model}
This section presents the physical model of the tromba marina with reference to the theory presented in Parts \ref{part:resonators}, \ref{part:exciters} and \ref{part:interactions}.
As much as possible, this chapter follows the notation of paper \citeP[D], as long as it is coherent with what has already been presented in this thesis. Any discrepancies between this chapter and the paper will be clearly highlighted. 

\subsection{Continuous time}
The full musical instrument has been divided into three parts: the string, the bridge and the body, each of which will briefly be presented here. Each resonator in isolation is of the form 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:trombaPDEForm}
    \L q = 0
\end{equation}
where $\L$ is a linear (partial) differential operator and $q(\boldsymbol{x}, t)$ describes the state of the component in isolation. $q$ is defined for time $t\geq 0$ and spatial coordinate $\boldsymbol{x}\in \D$ where the dimensions of domain $\D$ depend on the dimensions of the system at hand. Using the form in Eq. \eqref{eq:trombaPDEForm} allows for a much more compact notation later on. In the following, subscripts `s', `m' and `p' will be used to denote the `string', `bridge' (mass), and `body' (plate) respectively.

\subsubsection{String}
The string of the tromba marina is modelled as a damped stiff string of length $L$ (in m) (see Chapter \ref{ch:stiffString}). With reference to the form in \eqref{eq:trombaPDEForm}, its transverse displacement is described by $q = u(\chi, t)$ (in m) and is defined for $\chi \in \D_\stxt$ where domain $\D_\stxt = [0, L]$.\footnote{Notice that $\chi$ rather than $x$ is used here. As $x$ will be used as a spatial coordinate for the body later on, a different symbol is used for the string to differentiate between two coordinate-systems.} Using partial differential operator $\L = \L_\text{s}$, the PDE describing its motion is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:trombaStiffString}
    \L_\stxt u =  0,
\end{equation}
where (see Eq. \eqref{eq:stiffStringPDE})
\begin{equation*}
    \L_\stxt = \rho_\stxt A \ptt - T\partial_\chi^2 + E_\text{s}I\partial_\chi^4+2\rho_\stxt A\szX[\stxt]\pt-2\rho_\stxt A\soX[\stxt]\pt\partial_\chi^2\ .
\end{equation*}
The parameters are as defined for Eq. \eqref{eq:stiffStringPDE} with the possible addition of the `s' subscript.
Compared to the schemes presented in previous chapters, using a partial differential operator to combine all operators like this, is solely different from a notational point of view, and does not change the behaviour of the system. If Eq. \eqref{eq:trombaStiffString} is expanded and all terms except for $\rho_\stxt A \ptt$ are moved to the right-hand side, one arrives at the damped stiff string PDE in Eq. \eqref{eq:stiffStringPDE} again.

As the string is bowed, one can extend the PDE in \eqref{eq:trombaStiffString} to 
\begin{equation}
    \L_\stxt u =  - \delta(\chi-\chi_\text{B})F_\text{B}\Phi(\vrel),
\end{equation}
with bow position $\chi_\text{B} = \chi_\text{B}(t) \in \D_\stxt$ (in m), bow force $F_\text{B} = F_\text{B}(t)$ and relative velocity between the bow and the string $\vrel=\vrel(t)$. The static friction model in Eq. \eqref{eq:staticFriction} has been chosen for simplicity. For more details on this bow model, see Section \ref{sec:staticFricMod}.

\subsubsection{Bridge}
The bridge is modelled using a mass-spring-damper system (see Section \ref{sec:massSpringDamping}). With reference to Eq. \eqref{eq:trombaPDEForm}, the transverse displacement of the mass is described by $q = w(t)$ (in m) and using differential operator $\L = \L_\text{m}$, its PDE is 
\begin{equation}
    \L_\text{m} w = 0,
\end{equation}
where (see Eq. \eqref{eq:massSpringDampingPDE})
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L}_\text{m}=M\frac{d^2}{dt^2}+M\omega_0^2+M\sigma_\text{m}\frac{d}{dt}.
\end{equation*}
Here, $\omega_0 = \sqrt{K/M}$ (in s$^{-1}$) and $\sigma_\text{m} = R/M$ (in s$^{-1}$) and other parameters are as in Eq. \eqref{eq:massSpringDampingPDE}.\footnote{In paper \citeP[D], the symbol $R$ is used for the damping coefficient, but for coherence in this work, $\sigma_\text{m}$ is used instead.} 

Notice that when using a differential operator for an ODE, the dots to denote a temporal derivative (as e.g. Eq. \eqref{eq:massSpringDampingPDE}) need to be written in an operator form. Here, Leibniz's notation is chosen (see Section \ref{sec:differentialEquations}). 


\subsubsection{Body}
The body of the instrument is simplified to a damped rectangular thin plate of side lengths $L_x$ and $L_y$ (in m) (see Section \ref{sec:thinPlate}). Again, with reference to Eq. \eqref{eq:trombaPDEForm}, its transverse displacement is described by $q = z(x, y, t)$ (in m) and is defined for $(x, y) \in \D_\ptxt$ where domain $\D_\ptxt = [0, L_x] \times [0, L_y]$. Using partial differential operator $\L = \L_\ptxt$, the PDE describing the motion of the body is 
\begin{equation}
    \L_\ptxt z = 0,
\end{equation}
where (see Eq. \eqref{eq:platePDE})
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L}_\text{p} = \rho_\text{p}H\partial_t^2 + D\Delta\Delta +2\rho_\text{p}H\sigma_{0,\text{p}}\partial_t-2\rho_\text{p}H\sigma_{1,\text{p}}\partial_t\Delta,
\end{equation*}
with $D = E_\ptxt H^3/12(1-\nu^2)$. Again, parameters are as defined in Eq. \eqref{eq:platePDE}.

\subsubsection{Interactions}
The three components interact using the non-iterative collision methods presented in Chapter \ref{ch:collisions}. Recalling the importance of the relative location of the various objects (see Section \ref{sec:massRigidBarrier}), the string is placed above the bridge, which is placed above the body. This arrangement will, in turn, determine the definitions of $\eta$ and the directions of the forces in the eventual system. In the following, subscripts `sm' and `mp' are used to denote a `string-mass' and `mass-plate' interaction respectively.

The bridge-body interaction is modelled using the collision-potential in Eq. \eqref{eq:potential}:
\begin{equation}
    \phi(\eta) = \frac{K_\mp}{\alpha_\mp+1}[\eta_\mp]_+^{\alpha_\mp+1},
\end{equation}
where $\eta_\mp = \eta_\mp(t) = w(t) - z(x_\mp, y_\mp, t)$ and the location on the plate where the bridge collides is $(x_\mp, y_\mp)\in \D_\ptxt$. 

The string interacts with the bridge using the two-sided collision potential presented in Eq. \eqref{eq:twoSidedPotential}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stringMassPotential}
    \phi(\eta_\sm) = \frac{K_\sm}{\alpha_\sm+1}|\eta_\sm|^{\alpha_\sm+1},
\end{equation}
which acts as a connection.  Here, $\eta_\sm = \eta_\sm(t) = u(\chi_\sm, t) - w(t)$ (in m) and the location of where the bridge is connected along the string is $\chi_\sm \in \D_\stxt$. 

Recalling the process of writing the collision potential in quadratic form in Eq. \eqref{eq:quadraticPotential}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:quadraticPotentialTromba}
    \phi'(\eta) = \psi\psi' \quad \text{where} \quad \psi = \sqrt{2\phi} \quad \text{and} \quad \psi' = \frac{\dot{\psi}}{\dot{\eta}}\ ,
\end{equation}
the complete system can be written next.

\subsubsection{Complete system}
Looking towards discretisation, the separate variables $g_\sm=\psi_\sm'$ and $g_\mp=\psi_\mp'$ are used and the full system can be written as 
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:trombaSystemPDE}
    \begin{align}
        \L_\text{s}u &= -\delta(\chi-\chi_\Btxt)F_\Btxt + \delta(\chi - \chi_\sm)\psi_\sm g_\sm,\\
        \L_\text{m}w &= - \psi_\sm g_\sm + \psi_\mp g_\mp,\\
        \L_\text{p}z &= -\delta(x-x_\mp, y-y_\mp)\psi_\mp g_\mp,\\
        \dot\psi_\sm &= g_\sm \dot \eta_\sm,\label{eq:trombaPDEPsiSM}\\
        \dot\psi_\mp &= g_\mp \dot \eta_\mp,\label{eq:trombaPDEPsiMP}\\
        \eta_\sm(t) &= w(t) - u(\chi_\sm, t),\label{eq:etaSMinSystem}\\
        \eta_\mp(t) &= z(x_\mp, y_\mp, t) - w(t).
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
See Figure \ref{fig:trombaSystem} for a visual overview of system \eqref{eq:trombaSystemPDE}. Notice that when compared to the system presented in paper \citeP[D], Eqs. \eqref{eq:trombaPDEPsiSM} and \eqref{eq:trombaPDEPsiMP} have been added for coherence with the theory presented in Chapter \ref{ch:collisions}, as well as the introduction of $g_\sm$ and $g_\mp$ already in the continuous system.

    \caption{A visualisation of system \eqref{eq:trombaSystemPDE} with various important coordinates highlighted. The figure includes the offset and the damping finger described in paper \citeP[D]. Note that $\eta_\text{sm}$ (Eq. \eqref{eq:etaSMinSystem}) is not shown as it is close to 0 at all times. (Figure taken from \citeP[D].)}
    \label{fig:trombaSystem}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Discrete time}
Using the process explained in Section \ref{sec:solvingMassBarrier} for discretising the collision terms and introducing\footnote{The definition for $\xi^n$ was wrong in paper \citeP[D], where $\psi^{n-1/2}$ was subtracted rather than added. It has been corrected here and included in Appendix \ref{app:paperErrata}.} 
\begin{equation}
    \xi^n = \frac{k}{2}g^n\delta_{t\cdot}\eta^n + \psi^{n-1/2},
\end{equation}
for brevity, system \eqref{eq:trombaSystemPDE} can be discretised as follows:\footnote{Notice that subscript $l$ is used as a spatial index for both the string and the plate for coherency with the paper, but are used as an index for different coordinate systems.}

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:trombaSystemFDS}
    \begin{align}
        \ell_\text{s}\uln &= -J_{l,3}(\chi_\text{B})F_\Btxt + J_{l,0}(\chi_\sm)\xi_\sm^n g^n_\sm,\label{eq:trombaSystemFDSString}\\
        \ell_\text{m}w^n &= - \xi_\sm^n g^n_\sm + \xi_\mp^n g^n_\mp,\label{eq:trombaSystemFDSMass}\\
        \ell_\text{p}\zlmn &= -J_{(l,m),0}(x_\mp, y_\mp)\xi_\mp^n g^n_\mp,\label{eq:trombaSystemFDSPlate}\\
        \dtp\psi^{n-1/2}_\sm &= g^n_\sm \dtd \eta^n_\sm,\label{eq:psiSM}\\
        \dtp\psi^{n-1/2}_\mp &= g^n_\mp \dtd \eta^n_\mp,\label{eq:psiMP}\\
        \eta^n_\sm &= w^n - \ubr^n,\label{eq:etaSM}\\
        \eta^n_\mp &= \zbr^n - w^n,\label{eq:etaMP}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where the discrete linear (partial) differential operators $\ell$ are the discrete counterparts of $\L$ in system \eqref{eq:trombaSystemPDE} and are discretised as shown in their respective chapters as
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:fdsOperators}
\begin{align}
    \ell_\text{s} &=\rho_\text{s}A\delta_{tt}- T\dcc + EI\dcccc+ 2\rho_\text{s}A\sigma_{0,\text{s}}\delta_{t\cdot}-2\rho_\text{s}A\sigma_{1,\text{s}}\delta_{t-}\dcc,\\
    \ell_\text{b} &= M\delta_{tt} + M\omega_0^2 + M\sigma_\text{m} \delta_{t\cdot},\\
    \ell_\text{p} &= \rho_\text{p} H \delta_{tt} + D\dDelta\dDelta + 2\rho_\text{p}H\sigma_{0, \text{p}}\delta_{t\cdot} - 2\rho_\text{p}H\sigma_{1, \text{p}}\delta_{t-}\dDelta.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Furthermore, the definitions for $g_\sm^n$ and $g_\mp^n$ can be found in Eq. \eqref{eq:gDef}\footnote{Paper \citeP[D] still uses the old definition of $g^n$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:gDefOld}.} and $J_{l,0}(\chi_\sm)$ and $J_{l,3}(\chi_\text{B})$ are the $0$\thOrder and cubic spreading operators respectively, as defined in Section \ref{sec:interpolationSpreading} and $J_{(l,m),0}(x_\mp, y_\mp)$ is a $0$\thOrder 2D spreading operator as defined in Section \ref{sec:interpolationSpreading2D}.

As $0$\thOrder spreading operators are used for the collision terms in the string and body FD schemes, the definitions of Eqs. \eqref{eq:etaSM} and \eqref{eq:etaMP} do not use interpolation operators to obtain the string and plate values. Instead, for brevity, $\ubr^n = u_{l_\sm}^n$ with $l_\sm = \floor[\chi_\sm / h_\stxt]$ and $\zbr^n = z_{(l_\mp, m_\mp)}^n$ with $(l_\mp, m_\mp) = (\floor[x_\mp / h_\ptxt], \floor[y_\mp / h_\ptxt])$ are introduced for the string and the plate respectively. Here $h_\stxt$ is the grid spacing for the string and $h_\ptxt$ that for the plate. 

There are a few components presented in paper \citeP[D] that the system does not include here. These are the offset $w_\text{off}$ between the mass and the plate as well as the damping finger that interacts with the string to play different pitches. As the focus of this chapter is on the process of solving the system at the bridge for which these two components are not important, these will be ignored to avoid additional complexity. Further details on these components are provided in the paper.

\section{Implementation details}
This section extends on paper \citeP[D] by providing more details on the solution of the string-bridge-body interaction.

Following Section \ref{sec:massString} one could expand Eqs. \eqref{eq:trombaSystemFDSString}, \eqref{eq:trombaSystemFDSMass} and \eqref{eq:trombaSystemFDSPlate} and treat these as a system of linear equations (see Section \ref{sec:linearEquations}). This would require an inversion of a $3\times 3$ matrix each iteration.
To simplify things slightly, and looking towards real-time implementation, one could instead solve for $\delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\sm^n$ and $\delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\mp^n$ directly, which would require a $2\times 2$ matrix inversion each iteration and requires much fewer operations (see Section \ref{sec:realTimeMatrices}).

% In the following, a short-hand notation is used for the grid points along the string and the plate that the bridge interacts with. These are . \todo{shorthand of shorthand?} Furthermore, a
As it is assumed that one will not bow the bridge, i.e. $\chi_\text{B} \neq \chi_\sm$, the bowing term will be disregarded when calculating the interaction between the components. 

Recalling \eqref{eq:etaSM} and \eqref{eq:etaMP}, one can write the following:
\begin{equation*}
    \delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\sm^n = \delta_{t\cdot}(w^n - \ubr^n) \qaq\delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\mp^n = \delta_{t\cdot}(\zbr^n - w^n),
\end{equation*}
and expanding the right-hand sides yields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:expandedEtas}
\begin{aligned}
    \delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\sm^n &= \frac{w^{n+1}-w^{n-1}-\ubr^{n+1}+\ubr^{n-1}}{2k} \quad \text{and}\\ \delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\mp^n &= \frac{\zbr^{n+1}-\zbr^{n-1}-w^{n+1}+w^{n-1}}{2k}\ .
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
To solve the system, inner product of Eqs. \eqref{eq:trombaSystemFDSString} and \eqref{eq:trombaSystemFDSPlate} are taken with $J_{l,0}(\chi_\sm)$ and $J_{(l,m),0}(x_\mp, y_\mp)$ respectively. As $0$\thOrder spreading operators are used, their norms over discrete string domain $d_\stxt$ and discrete plate domain $d_\ptxt$, respectively, reduce as follows (also see Eq. \eqref{eq:shorthandJ}): $\lVert J_{l,0}(\chi_\sm) \rVert_{d_\stxt}^2 = 1/h_\stxt$ and $\lVert J_{(l,m),0}(x_\mp, y_\mp)\rVert_{d_\ptxt}^2 = 1/h_\ptxt^2$. This yields the following updates for Eqs. \eqref{eq:trombaSystemFDSString}, \eqref{eq:trombaSystemFDSMass} and \eqref{eq:trombaSystemFDSPlate} at the locations of interaction
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:statesBridgeNext}
    \begin{align}
        % \left(\frac{\rho_\text{s}A}{k^2}+\frac{\rho_\text{s}A\sigma_{0,\text{s}}}{k}\right) \ubr^{n+1} =

        % \left(\frac{M}{k^2}+\frac{M\sigma_\text{m}}{2k}\right)w^{n+1} = &\ \frac{M}{k^2}(2w^n-w^{n-1}) - M\omega_0^2w^n + \frac{M\sigma_\text{m}}{2k}w^{n-1}-\left(\frac{(g_\sm^n)^2k}{2}\delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\sm^n+\psi_\sm^{n-1/2}\right)\\
        % &+\left(\frac{(g_\mp^n)^2k}{2}\delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\mp^n+\psi_\mp^{n-1/2}\right)\nonumber
        w^{n+1} = w^\star&-\frac{k^2}{M\left(1+\frac{\sigma_\text{m}k}{2}\right)}\left(\frac{(g_\sm^n)^2k}{2}\delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\sm^n+\psi_\sm^{n-1/2}g_\sm^n\right)\\
        &+\frac{k^2}{M\left(1+\frac{\sigma_\text{m}k}{2}\right)}\left(\frac{(g_\mp^n)^2k}{2}\delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\mp^n+\psi_\mp^{n-1/2}g_\mp^n\right),\nonumber\\
        \zbr^{n+1} =\zbr^\star&-\frac{k^2}{h_\text{p}^2\rho_\text{p}H(1+\sigma_{0,\text{p}}k)}\left(\frac{(g_\mp^n)^2k}{2}\delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\mp^n+\psi_\mp^{n-1/2}g_\mp^n\right),
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where the update equations of the components in isolation (without the collision terms) at their respective interaction locations are
\begin{align*}
    \ubr^\star& = \frac{2\ubr^n\!-\!\ubr^{n-1}\!+\!c^2k^2\delta_{xx}\ubr^n\!-\!\kappa_\stxt^2k^2\delta_{xxxx}\ubr^n\! +\! \sigma_{0,\text{s}}k\ubr^{n-1}\! +\! 2\sigma_{1,\text{s}}k^2\delta_{t-}\delta_{xx}\ubr^n}{1 + \sigma_{0,\text{s}}k}, \\
    w^\star & = \frac{2w^n-w^{n-1}-k^2\omega_0^2w^n+\frac{\sigma_\text{m}k}{2}w^{n-1}}{1 + \frac{\sigma_\text{m}k}{2}},\\
    \zbr^\star & = \frac{2\zbr^n-\zbr^{n-1}-\kappa_\ptxt^2k^2\dDelta\dDelta\zbr^n+\sigma_{0,\text{p}}k\zbr^{n-1}+ 2\sigma_{1,\text{p}}k^2\delta_{t-}\dDelta\zbr^n}{1+\sigma_{0,\text{p}}k},
\end{align*}
with $c = \sqrt{T/\rho_\stxt A}$, $\kappa_\stxt = \sqrt{E_\stxt I /\rho_\stxt A}$ and $\kappa_\ptxt = \sqrt{D / \rho_\ptxt H}$.  

The definitions in Eqs. \eqref{eq:statesBridgeNext} can then be inserted into Eqs. \eqref{eq:expandedEtas} and solved for $\delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\sm^n$ and $\delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\mp^n$. This can be treated as a system of linear equations and be solved according to
\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\sm^n\\
        \delta_{t\cdot}\eta_\mp^n
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{v},

where
\begin{equation}

The solutions obtained for $\dtd \eta_\sm^n$ and $\dtd \eta_\mp^n$, can then be used directly in $\xi_\sm^n$ and $\xi_\mp^n$ in Eqs. \eqref{eq:trombaSystemFDSString}, \eqref{eq:trombaSystemFDSMass} and \eqref{eq:trombaSystemFDSPlate} to calculate $u_l^{n+1}$, $w^{n+1}$ and $z_{(l,m)}^{n+1}$ respectively. They can also be used directly to calculate $\psi^{n+1/2}_\sm$ and $\psi^{n+1/2}_\mp$ in Eqs. \eqref{eq:psiSM} and \eqref{eq:psiMP} respectively.

Figure \ref{fig:trombaExcite} shows three consecutive plots of the system excited with a raised cosine. The bow is not used here, to highlight the collision. One can observe that the string forces the mass downwards through their connection, causing the latter to collide with the plate.

\subsection{Energy analysis}
Using the energy analysis techniques presented in Section \ref{sec:energyAnalysis}, the total energy of the system can be shown to be of the following form:
\begin{equation}
    \dtp\left(\h_\stxt + \h_\mtxt + \h_\ptxt + \h_\sm + \h_\mp\right) = -\q_\stxt - \q_\mtxt - \q_\ptxt - \q_\Btxt - \p_\Btxt.
\end{equation}
Here, the total energy of the string is (Eq. \eqref{eq:energyBalanceStiffString}),
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{gathered}
        \h_\stxt = \frac{\rho_\stxt A}{2}\lVert\dtm \uln\rVert^2_{d_\stxt} + \frac{T}{2}\langle\dxp\uln, e_{t-}\dxp\uln\rangle_{\underline{d_\stxt}} + \frac{E_\stxt I}{2}\langle\dxx\uln, e_{t-}\dxx\uln\rangle_{\overline{\underline{d_\stxt}}}\ ,
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation*}
the total energy of the mass is (Eq. \eqref{eq:energyBalanceMassSpringDamper}) 
\begin{equation*}
    \h_\mtxt = \frac{M}{2}(\dtm w^n)^2 + \frac{K}{2}w^n e_{t-}w^n,
\end{equation*}
and the total energy of the plate is (Eq. \eqref{eq:energyBalanceThinPlate})
\begin{equation*}
    \h_\ptxt = \frac{\rho_\ptxt H}{2} \left\lVert\delta_{t-}\zlmn\right\rVert_{d_\ptxt}^2 + \frac{D}{2}\langle\dDelta \zlmn, e_{t-}\dDelta \zlmn\rangle_{\overline{\underline{d_\ptxt}}}\ .
\end{equation*}
The energy of the string-mass connection and the mass-plate collision are (Eq. \eqref{eq:collisionEnergy})
\begin{equation*}
    \h_\sm = \frac{(\psi_\sm^{n-1/2})^2}{2}, \qaq \h_\mp = \frac{(\psi_\mp^{n-1/2})^2}{2},
\end{equation*}
respectively.

The damping terms are defined for the string as (Eq. \eqref{eq:dampingTermStiffString})
\begin{equation*}
    \q_\stxt = 2\szX[\stxt] \rho_\stxt A \lVert\dtd\uln\rVert_{d_\stxt}^2 - 2 \soX[\stxt] \rho_\stxt A \langle \dtd \uln, \dtm \dxx \uln \rangle_{d_\stxt},
\end{equation*}  
for the mass as (Eq. \eqref{eq:massDampingEnergy})
\begin{equation*}
    \q_\mtxt = R\left(\dtd w^n \right)^2
\end{equation*}
and for the plate as (Eq. \eqref{eq:dampingTermThinPlate})
\begin{equation*}
    \mathfrak{q}_\ptxt = 2\sz \rho_\ptxt H \lVert\dtd\zlmn\rVert_{d_\ptxt}^2 - 2 \so \rho_\ptxt H \langle \dtd \zlmn, \dtm \dDelta\zlmn \rangle_{d_\ptxt}.
\end{equation*}

Finally, the power dissipated and supplied by the bow are defined as (Eq. \eqref{eq:energyBalanceBow})
\begin{equation*}
    \q_\Btxt =  f_\Btxt^n \Phi(\vrel^n) \vrel^n \qaq \p_\Btxt = f_\Btxt^n \Phi(\vrel^n)v_\Btxt^n,
\end{equation*}
respectively. 

Figure \ref{fig:trombaEnergy} shows the plots of the energy for an implementation of the tromba marina presented in this chapter without losses. The system is excited with a raised cosine for clarity of the figures and plots correspond to the system states shown in Figure \ref{fig:trombaExcite}.
