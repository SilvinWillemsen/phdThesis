\chapter{Large Scale Modular Physical Models}\label{ch:largeScale}
This chapter will provide an extended summary for the work presented in the papers ``Real-Time Control of Large-Scale Modular Physical Models using the Sensel Morph'' \citeP[A] and ``Physical Models and Real-Time Control with the Sensel Morph'' \citeP[B]. Paper \citeP[A] presents the work done on various physical models connected by nonlinear springs using three instruments as case studies: the esraj (bowed sitar), the hammered dulcimer and the hurdy gurdy. This chapter will introduce the models used with reference to the previous chapters and will build on the contents of paper \citeP[A] by providing more details on the implementation.

\section{Models}
All instruments use multiple instances of the stiff string presented in Chapter \ref{ch:stiffString} and the thin plate presented in Section \ref{sec:thinPlate} same set of models: The models used are the
